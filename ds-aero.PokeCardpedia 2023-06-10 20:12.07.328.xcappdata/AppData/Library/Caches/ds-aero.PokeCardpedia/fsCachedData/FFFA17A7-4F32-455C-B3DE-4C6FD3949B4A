If your opponent declines (or if both Benches are full), draw 2 cards. If your opponent accepts, each of you searches your decks for any number of Basic Pokémon cards and puts them face down onto your Benches. (A player can't do this if his or her Bench is full.) When you both have finished, shuffle your decks and turn those cards face up."],"set":{"id":"base6","name":"Legendary Collection","series":"Other","printedTotal":110,"total":110,"legalities":{"unlimited":"Legal"},"ptcgoCode":"LC","releaseDate":"2002/05/24","updatedAt":"2020/08/14 09:35:00","images":{"symbol":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/symbol.png","logo":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/logo.png"}},"number":"106","artist":"Kagemaru Himeno","rarity":"Uncommon","legalities":{"unlimited":"Legal"},"images":{"small":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/106.png","large":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/106_hires.png"},"tcgplayer":{"url":"https://prices.pokemontcg.io/tcgplayer/base6-106","updatedAt":"2023/06/10","prices":{"normal":{"low":0.39,"mid":0.8,"high":1.99,"market":0.89,"directLow":0.62},"reverseHolofoil":{"low":130.0,"mid":140.0,"high":149.99,"market":27.73,"directLow":null}}},"cardmarket":{"url":"https://prices.pokemontcg.io/cardmarket/base6-106","updatedAt":"2023/06/10","prices":{"averageSellPrice":0.35,"lowPrice":0.02,"trendPrice":0.23,"germanProLow":0.0,"suggestedPrice":0.0,"reverseHoloSell":0.0,"reverseHoloLow":16.0,"reverseHoloTrend":25.76,"lowPriceExPlus":0.09,"avg1":0.04,"avg7":0.29,"avg30":0.38,"reverseHoloAvg1":29.88,"reverseHoloAvg7":25.05,"reverseHoloAvg30":15.61}}},{"id":"base6-107","name":"Energy Retrieval","supertype":"Trainer","rules":["Trade 1 of the other cards in your hand for up to 2 basic Energy cards from your discard pile."],"set":{"id":"base6","name":"Legendary Collection","series":"Other","printedTotal":110,"total":110,"legalities":{"unlimited":"Legal"},"ptcgoCode":"LC","releaseDate":"2002/05/24","updatedAt":"2020/08/14 09:35:00","images":{"symbol":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/symbol.png","logo":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/logo.png"}},"number":"107","artist":"Keiji Kinebuchi","rarity":"Uncommon","legalities":{"unlimited":"Legal","standard":"Legal","expanded":"Legal"},"images":{"small":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/107.png","large":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/107_hires.png"},"tcgplayer":{"url":"https://prices.pokemontcg.io/tcgplayer/base6-107","updatedAt":"2023/06/10","prices":{"normal":{"low":0.17,"mid":0.45,"high":1.99,"market":0.34,"directLow":0.26},"reverseHolofoil":{"low":28.49,"mid":31.98,"high":44.97,"market":27.37,"directLow":null}}},"cardmarket":{"url":"https://prices.pokemontcg.io/cardmarket/base6-107","updatedAt":"2023/06/10","prices":{"averageSellPrice":0.32,"lowPrice":0.02,"trendPrice":0.27,"germanProLow":0.0,"suggestedPrice":0.0,"reverseHoloSell":0.0,"reverseHoloLow":10.5,"reverseHoloTrend":26.65,"lowPriceExPlus":0.2,"avg1":0.02,"avg7":0.27,"avg30":0.37,"reverseHoloAvg1":16.95,"reverseHoloAvg7":23.55,"reverseHoloAvg30":16.64}}},{"id":"base6-108","name":"Bill","supertype":"Trainer","rules":["Draw 2 cards."],"set":{"id":"base6","name":"Legendary Collection","series":"Other","printedTotal":110,"total":110,"legalities":{"unlimited":"Legal"},"ptcgoCode":"LC","releaseDate":"2002/05/24","updatedAt":"2020/08/14 09:35:00","images":{"symbol":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/symbol.png","logo":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/logo.png"}},"number":"108","artist":"Ken Sugimori","rarity":"Common","legalities":{"unlimited":"Legal"},"images":{"small":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/108.png","large":"https://images.pokemontcg.io/base6/108_hires.png"},"tcgplayer":{"url":"https://prices.pokemontcg.io/tcgplayer/base6-108","updatedAt":"2023/06/10","prices":{"normal":{"low":0.1,"mid":0.38,"high":1.99,"market":0.34,"directLow":null},"reverseHolofoil":{"low":21.19,"mid":32.5,"high":49.99,"market":31.0,"directLow":null}}},"cardmarket":{"url":"https://prices.pokemontcg.io/cardmarket/base6-108","updatedAt":"2023/06/10","prices":{"averageSellPrice":0.2,"lowPrice":0.02,"trendPrice":0.21,"germanProLow":0.0,"suggestedPrice":0.0,"reverseHoloSell":12.0,"reverseHoloLow":10.0,"reverseHoloTrend":15.27,"lowPriceExPlus":0.05,"avg1":0.02,"avg7":0.24,"avg30":0.15,"reverseHoloAvg1":12.0,"reverseHoloAvg7":15.43,"reverseHoloAvg30":20.72}}},{"id":"base6-109","name":"Mysterious Fossil","supertype":"Trainer","hp":"10","rules":["Play Mysterious Fossil as if it were a Basic Pokémon.
